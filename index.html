        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <b class="bold">In mathematics,</b> the Pythagorean theorem or Pythagoras' theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry between the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides. This theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b and the hypotenuse c, often called the Pythagorean equation.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Who made it?</h2>
        The theorem is named for the <b>Greek philosopher Pythagoras</b>, born around 570 BC. The theorem has been proven numerous times by many different methods â€“ possibly the most for any mathematical theorem. The proofs are diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years.

        <h2>How did He First Found It?</h2>
        <br>
        <b>The legend tells that Pythagoras was looking at the square tiles of Samos' palace,</b> waiting to be received by Polycrates, when he noticed that if one divides diagonally one of those squares, it turns out that the two halves are right triangles (whose area is half the area of the tile).

    <h2>How to Prove the Pythagorean Theorem</h2>
    <br><h3>Step 1</h3>
    <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5e/Prove-the-Pythagorean-Theorem-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/aid595842-v4-728px-Prove-the-Pythagorean-Theorem-Step-1-Version-3.jpg.webp">
    <br><br>
    <b>Draw four congruent right triangles. </b>Congruent triangles are ones that have three identical sides. Designate the legs of length a and b and hypotenuse of length c. The Pythagorean Theorem states that the sum of squares of the two legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse, so we need to prove a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
    <br><br><h3>Step2</h3>
    <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a8/Prove-the-Pythagorean-Theorem-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid595842-v4-728px-Prove-the-Pythagorean-Theorem-Step-2-Version-2.jpg.webp">
    <br><br>
    <b>Arrange the triangles so that they form a square with sides a+b.</b> With the triangles placed in this way, they will form a smaller square (in green) inside the larger square with four equal sides of length <b>c</b>, the hypotenuse of each triangle. The larger square has sides of length <b>a+b</b>.
    <br><br><h3>Step3</h3>
    <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/15/Prove-the-Pythagorean-Theorem-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid595842-v4-728px-Prove-the-Pythagorean-Theorem-Step-3-Version-2.jpg.webp">
    <br><br>
    <b>Rearrange the same four triangles such that they form two equal rectangles inside a larger square. </b>Again, the larger square will have sides of length <b>a+b</b>, but in this configuration there are two rectangles (in grey) of equal size and two smaller squares within the larger square. The larger of the smaller squares (in red) has sides of length <b>a</b>, while the smaller square (in blue) has sides of length <b>b</b>.
    <br><br><h3>Step4</h3>
    <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f9/Prove-the-Pythagorean-Theorem-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid595842-v4-728px-Prove-the-Pythagorean-Theorem-Step-4-Version-2.jpg.webp">
    <br><br>
    <b>Recognize that the area not formed by the triangles is equal in both arrangements.</b> In both cases, you have a large square with sides of <b>a+b</b>. Given this, the areas of both of the large squares are equal. Looking at both arrangements, you can see that the total area of the green square must equal the areas of the red and blue squares added together in the second arrangement.
    <br><br><h3>Step5</h3>
    <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3e/Prove-the-Pythagorean-Theorem-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid595842-v4-728px-Prove-the-Pythagorean-Theorem-Step-5-Version-2.jpg.webp">
    <br><br>
    <b>Set the areas of each arrangement equal to each other. </b>The blue area is <b>a^2</b>, the red area, <b>b^2</b> and the green area, <b>c^2</b>. The red and blue squares must be added together to equal the area of the green square; therefore, blue area + red area = green area: <b>a^2+b^2=c^2</b>.
